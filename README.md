Project Title: Secure Image Transmission using AES Encryption and Digital Signatures
Background Scenario:
In today’s data-driven world, organizations often transmit sensitive visual data across networks including but not limited to:
•	Medical institutions sharing patient diagnostic images such as X-rays, MRIs, or CT scans.
•	Military and intelligence agencies transmitting aerial surveillance or reconnaissance imagery.
•	Private companies sharing confidential design blueprints or visual prototypes.
Many of these images are transmitted over public or unsecured networks, such as the internet or shared wireless infrastructure. This exposes them to several major threats:
•	Eavesdropping and Interception: Hackers or adversaries could capture and store unprotected images in transit.
•	Data Tampering and Integrity Loss: Malicious actors could alter or inject harmful data into image files, misleading receivers or corrupting vital information.
•	Unauthorized Access and Privacy Breach: Sensitive personal or strategic data can be leaked, violating privacy laws (e.g., HIPAA in healthcare) or compromising national security.
